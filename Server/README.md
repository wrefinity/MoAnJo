## Install requirements

For local development

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Set environment variables

- Make a copy of the `sample.env` file, and rename it to `.env`

- Update the values of the variables in the `.env` file to suite your system environment.

- Create a folder named `logs` in the root directory, if it does not exist

## Datebase setup

### Create databases

Create an SQL database with the name matching what you have on the `.env` file for `DB_NAME` and `TEST_DB_NAME`. For example:

```
createdb moanjo
```

### Export your flask app

In order to run your migrations and app using the `flask` command, expose your flask app:

- for Linux / macOS

```
export FLASK_APP=src/server.py
```

- On BASH

```
export FLASK_APP="src/server.py"
```

- On POWERSHELL

```
$env:FLASK_APP="src/server.py"
```

### **Create database tables from migrations**

To add the existing database schema run:

```
flask db upgrade
```

Make your database changes accessible to others using migrations

```
flask db migrate
```

### **Run server application**

From the root folder, run

```
python src/server.py
```

The application will run at the specified port `APPLICATION_PORT` in `.env` file

The local URL to access the API should be `http://localhost:5000/`
